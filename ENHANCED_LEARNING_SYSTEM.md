# Enhanced Learning System Design

## üìã **System Overview**

The Fantasy Learning platform now features an advanced task management system where **group leaders can create custom weekly challenges** and the community verifies completion through **peer voting**. This creates a more flexible, accountable, and engaging learning environment.

## üéØ **How the Enhanced Learning System Works**

### **1. Group Leader Role**
- Group creators and admins can set up weekly tasks
- Choose between different task types based on learning objectives
- Set point values, due dates, and verification requirements
- Monitor group participation and completion rates

### **2. Task Types**

#### **ü§ñ Auto-Verifiable Tasks** 
- **Multiple Choice Quizzes**: Instantly graded knowledge checks
- **Coding Challenges**: Automated test validation
- **Math Problems**: Precise answer verification
- **Scoring**: Immediate feedback and point allocation

#### **üë• Manual Verification Tasks**
- **Physical Activities**: "Complete a 30-minute workout"
- **Reading Goals**: "Read Chapter 3 of 'Atomic Habits'"
- **Skill Practice**: "Practice piano for 1 hour"
- **Project Work**: "Create a presentation on quantum computing"
- **Scoring**: Community voting determines completion

#### **üèÜ Hybrid Tasks**
- **Combined Approach**: Quiz + peer verification
- **Example**: "Take the JavaScript fundamentals quiz AND build a small project"
- **Scoring**: Auto-score + peer approval for full points

### **3. Peer Verification Process**

When someone submits evidence for a manual task:

1. **Submission Phase**
   - User provides written description of what they did
   - Optional: Upload photos, links, or documents as evidence
   - Submission deadline based on task due date

2. **Voting Phase** 
   - Other group members review submissions
   - Cast votes: **Approve**, **Reject**, or **Abstain**
   - Optional comments for feedback
   - Voting deadline (24-48 hours after submission)

3. **Resolution Phase**
   - System calculates approval percentage
   - Tasks approved if they meet the threshold (default: 60%)
   - Points awarded based on approval rate and task difficulty
   - Elo ratings updated based on final scores

## üéÆ **Example Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Fitness Challenge**
**Group Leader Creates:**
- **Task**: "Complete 30 minutes of exercise"
- **Type**: Manual verification
- **Evidence Required**: Yes
- **Evidence Prompt**: "Describe your workout and upload a photo"
- **Points**: 15
- **Approval Threshold**: 60%

**User Experience:**
1. Alice submits: "Did a 45-minute run in the park" + photo of her running app
2. Group members vote:
   - Bob: Approve ("Great job!")
   - Charlie: Approve
   - Diana: Approve
3. **Result**: 100% approval ‚Üí Alice gets 15 points + rating boost

### **Scenario 2: Learning Challenge**
**Group Leader Creates:**
- **Task**: "Learn React Hooks Fundamentals"
- **Type**: Hybrid
- **Quiz**: 5 questions about useState, useEffect, etc.
- **Evidence Required**: Yes
- **Evidence Prompt**: "Build a simple counter app using hooks"
- **Points**: 25 (15 auto + 10 peer)

**User Experience:**
1. Bob takes quiz: Gets 4/5 correct = 12 auto points
2. Bob submits counter app link
3. Peer voting approves the project (80% approval)
4. **Final Score**: 12 + 8 = 20/25 points

### **Scenario 3: Reading Challenge**
**Group Leader Creates:**
- **Task**: "Read 'Deep Work' Chapter 1"
- **Type**: Manual + Quiz hybrid
- **Quiz**: 3 comprehension questions
- **Evidence**: "Write a 200-word summary"
- **Approval Threshold**: 75% (higher for academic content)

## üí° **Key Benefits**

### **For Group Leaders**
- **Flexibility**: Create tasks aligned with group goals
- **Control**: Set difficulty levels and verification standards
- **Insights**: Track group engagement and completion rates
- **Community Building**: Foster accountability and support

### **For Participants**
- **Accountability**: Peer verification encourages genuine effort
- **Motivation**: Social pressure and recognition drive completion
- **Learning**: Exposure to others' approaches and solutions
- **Fairness**: Community voting prevents gaming the system

### **For the Platform**
- **Engagement**: More diverse and relevant challenges
- **Retention**: Community involvement increases stickiness
- **Scalability**: User-generated content reduces AI dependency
- **Quality**: Peer review maintains high standards

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema**
- **Tasks**: Title, description, type, points, deadlines, settings
- **Submissions**: Evidence text/URLs, auto-scores, status
- **Votes**: Approve/reject/abstain with optional comments
- **Automated Scoring**: Real-time vote tallying and status updates

### **API Endpoints**
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new tasks (leaders only)
- `GET /api/tasks?groupId=X` - Get group tasks
- `POST /api/tasks/submissions` - Submit task evidence
- `GET /api/tasks/submissions?taskId=X&forVoting=true` - Get submissions to vote on
- `POST /api/tasks/votes` - Cast votes on submissions

### **User Interface**
- **TaskCreator**: Rich form for leaders to design tasks
- **TaskCard**: Display tasks with submission and voting interfaces
- **VotingCard**: Review submissions and cast votes
- **TaskDashboard**: Overview of all group tasks and progress

## üìä **Scoring & Incentives**

### **Point Allocation**
- **Auto Tasks**: Immediate scoring based on correctness
- **Manual Tasks**: Points = Base Points √ó Approval Rate
- **Hybrid Tasks**: Auto Points + (Peer Points √ó Approval Rate)

### **Elo Rating Updates**
- **Successful Completion**: +Rating based on task difficulty
- **High Approval Rate**: Bonus rating for quality work
- **Consistent Participation**: Streak bonuses
- **Leadership**: Creating engaging tasks earns reputation

### **Anti-Gaming Measures**
- **No Self-Voting**: Cannot vote on own submissions
- **Minimum Voters**: Require multiple votes before resolution
- **Voting Deadlines**: Prevent last-minute manipulation
- **Comment Requirements**: Encourage thoughtful feedback
- **Historical Tracking**: Detect voting patterns and bias
